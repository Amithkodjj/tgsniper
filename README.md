# TG Star Gift Sniper

A Telegram bot that monitors and automatically purchases profitable star gifts on the resale market.

## Features

- Continuous monitoring of Telegram star gift resale market
- Profit margin analysis for gift arbitrage opportunities
- Concurrent scanning for improved performance
- Discord notifications for successful purchases
- Configurable price ranges and profit thresholds
- Session persistence for uninterrupted operation
- TON resale support: scans, analyzes and buys in Stars and TON separately (no cross-currency mixing)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tgsniper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -U https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/archive/v1.zip
```

3. Create environment configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Configure your settings in `.env`:
   - Get your Telegram API credentials from https://my.telegram.org
   - Set up Discord webhook URL for notifications (optional)
   - Adjust price ranges and profit thresholds as needed

## Configuration

All configuration is handled through environment variables in the `.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `API_ID` | Telegram API ID | Required |
| `API_HASH` | Telegram API Hash | Required |
| `SESSION_NAME` | Telegram session name | marketchecker |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord webhook for notifications | Optional |
| `MIN_PRICE` | Minimum Stars price to consider | 600 |
| `MAX_PRICE` | Maximum Stars price to consider | 1600 |
| `MIN_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE` | Minimum profit margin required (Stars) | 30 |
| `ENABLE_TON_SNIPING` | Enable sniping gifts priced in TON | false |
| `MIN_TON_PRICE` | Minimum TON price to consider | 0 |
| `MAX_TON_PRICE` | Maximum TON price to consider | 10000 |
| `MIN_TON_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE` | Minimum profit margin required (TON) | 30 |
| `USE_CONCURRENT` | Enable concurrent scanning | true |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | Concurrent batch size | 50 |
| `SCAN_INTERVAL` | Seconds between scans | 1.0 |
| `SUMMARY_INTERVAL` | Scans between Discord summaries | 100 |

## Usage

Run the sniper:
```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will:
1. Connect to Telegram using your credentials
2. Fetch all available star gifts
3. Continuously scan for resale opportunities
4. Analyze profit margins
5. Automatically purchase profitable gifts
6. Send Discord notifications for successful purchases

## How It Works

1. **Market Scanning**: Fetches all available star gifts and their resale listings. Each resale listing is normalized from the new `resale_amount` array which may include Stars and/or TON prices.
2. **Per-currency Profit Analysis**: Gifts are grouped by type and analyzed separately per currency (Stars vs TON). Profit is computed between the lowest and second-lowest prices in the same currency only.
3. **Filtering**: Only considers entries within configured price ranges and per-currency minimum profit thresholds.
4. **Automated Purchase**: For a selected opportunity, the bot purchases in the same currency. For TON purchases, the invoice includes `ton=True` to comply with the new API.
5. **Notifications**: Discord alerts include price and profit with the correct currency (‚≠ê for Stars, TON for TON) and periodic summaries.

## Safety Features

- Floor price filtering to avoid low-value collections
- Error handling for network issues and API limits
- Session persistence to maintain login state
- Configurable scan intervals to avoid rate limiting
